        "feedback": "1. **Structure (5 pts)**: The presentation has a brief introduction, but there's no clear body or conclusion. To improve, consider organizing your content in a more structured format to make it easier for the audience to follow along and remember key points.\n\n2. **Delivery (6 pts)**: Your delivery could be improved by focusing on maintaining a consistent tone throughout your presentation. The self-deprecating comments may come off as nervousness, which can distract from your message. Practice speaking with confidence and a steady pace to enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Content (7 pts)**: You have raised an important topic, global warming. However, the content seems limited and lacks depth. To make your presentation more persuasive, consider using concrete examples, statistics, or personal anecdotes that demonstrate the impact of global warming. Also, try to use a variety of vocabulary and ensure the information provided is relevant to your audience's interests.\n\nSome suggestions for improvement:\n- Develop an outline before starting your presentation to help guide your content and structure it effectively.\n- Practice your delivery to build confidence and reduce nervousness.\n- Use engaging visuals, facts, or stories to make your presentation more interesting and persuasive.\n- Consider researching additional information about global warming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic for your audience."

        "response": "Alright everyone, thanks for being here today. I want to quickly walk you through a new concept we've been developing. Essentially, we've identified a key inefficiency in our current workflow, and this new system aims to streamline that process. By automating certain tasks and centralizing our data, we anticipate a significant reduction in time spent on manual entry and a boost in overall productivity. We'll be rolling out a pilot program next month, and I'm confident you'll see the positive impact firsthand. We've prepared a brief overview document with more details, which I'll be sharing after this. I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have.",
        "feedback": "1. **Structure (9/10)**: The presentation has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, it could benefit from a more detailed introduction setting the context or problem being addressed, which would make the proposed solution even more compelling.\n\n  2. **Delivery (8/10)**: The delivery is clear and concise. The tone is engaging, but a bit more enthusiasm might help to sell the idea better. The pacing is good, though.\n\n  3. **Content (9/10)**: The content is persuasive, relevant, and well-explained. It could benefit from using more specific numbers or examples to make the anticipated benefits more tangible for the audience.\n\nOverall Score: 26/30\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n- Start with a brief context setting, explaining the current problem or inefficiency that your new system aims to solve.\n- Provide specific examples or numbers (e.g., time saved, productivity boost) to make the benefits more tangible for the audience.\n- Inject a bit more enthusiasm into your delivery to help sell the idea better and engage the audience."
